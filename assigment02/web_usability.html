            <h1>WEB usability</h1>

            <p>This page describes web usability and accessibility for some web sites.</p>



            <h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>

            <p>I have analised many personal web sites, and they differ in structure and content. Some of them focuses on portfolio, others 
            personal characteristics. However for IT professionals, the most part of them details the technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Related to structure, it seems to be a trend not to use many pages. All data can be seem vertically, using scroll bar,
                maybe because they are easier to read on mobile devices. For example, <a class="ext_link" 
                href="http://www.albinotonnina.com/">Albino Tonnina</a>  uses
                a timeline to struct the information, what I really think that is very clear. In my opition it has too much animation on transitions.
                Although, he provides a menu with links to main topics. These ones use the same idea, but with less animation:
                <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.keithhinman.com/interactive-resume/"> Keith Himan</a> and 
                <a class="ext_link" href="http://pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile">
                Pascal Vangermert</a>. One of the best that I saw was this: <a class="ext_link" href="http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/">
                Robby Leonard</a>, that was certainly built for his target audience.
            </p>
            <p>On the other site, structured as many pages and more traditional ones, can be very usefull for formal environments, as this 
            example: <a class="ext_link" href="http://www.callieschweitzer.com/">Callie Schweitzer</a>.</p>


            <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>


            <p>One website that I use regularly is <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.netflix.com"> Netflix</a>. 
            I really like movies and series so it is
            almost a survival matter!
            </p>
            <p>Its main objective is selling on demand streaming to any kind of audience: children, youths, matures, males, females,... in many
            countries around the world, with different cultures and tastes.
            </p>
            <p>So it needs to:
            </p>
            <ol> 
                <li>be easy to use and find  items that you want to see and </li>    
                <li>estimulate any customer to see other items</li>
            </ol> 



            <p> It deploys these objectives using always same layout, with searching tools and items categorized in lists,
            but the items in each list and trailler suggestions are individually 
            determined by the user's profile and usage, which clearly improves the user's curiosity.
            </p>



            <h2 id="color">Color usage</h2>
            <p>
                I like the collor pallete of this website <a class="ext_link" href="http://ellensriley.com/">Ellen Rilley</a>. It is collorful and cheerful,
                neverthless is not informal. The contrast between the background and the text color facilitates the reading, and even the pictures
                are hormonalized with the background.
            </p>

            <div id="color_panel">
                <p class="text_collor_panel">These are the main colors of the Ellen's site.</p>

            </div>





            <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
            <p>My favorite layout was <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.keithhinman.com/interactive-resume/"> Keith Himan</a>. His website is very clear and 
            easy to find information. He uses a timeline to ilustrate his profissional experience, what I have already said that I think that is
            a very good idea. The menu is always visible, so you can choose other information anytime. A "Top" button is always visible to, what is 
            useful in this one-page layouts.
            </p>
            <p>The use of two collumns is good to visualize much information keeping white-spaces. He uses collors in a more conventional
            way, and he restricts the fonts to 2 or 3 styles.So it is clean and stylish.
            </p>
