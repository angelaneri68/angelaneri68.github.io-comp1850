    <h1>Angela Neri</h1>
    <h2> Who am I ?</h2>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:30px">I am a Bachelor in Computer Science and I started my career as developer </p>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:25px">and I have developed a lot....</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px">
        but my career took a different path, and in the last few years I have been working as project manager, presales and as product manager.
        I would like to return to my origins! I really like to develop, and move to Canada may give me this chance.
        So I applied to Web Development Program to update my skills and practice coding.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:25px">I have already developed in C, Pascal, Prolog, SQL, Visual Basic (oh my God!), Delphi (!!), Assembler, LISP (!!!!).....</p>
    <p style="font-size:25px">COBOL I did not have a chance... but I have learned it at school, so yes, I am old  LOL </p>

    <h2>Things that I love: </h2>
