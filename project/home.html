            <h1>I am Angela Neri</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my interactive resume! <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I am Brazilian and moved to Vancouver in August 2018. My first objective was to improve my English,
                as the same time I was finishing my MBA. I am a Bachelor in Computer Science, just finished my MBA in December
                and now I am studying at BCIT. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                During my career, I have worked in different positions such as developer, system and business analyst,
                development manager, solution consultant, presales manager and product manager.

                Over the course of my career, I have developed an interesting skill set. Working at a critical mission software factory,
                I developed abilities to prioritize and execute tasks under pressure and keep the engagement of the team.
                As business analyst and consultant, I wrote many system specifications, mapped and modeled processes.
                As presales, I had the opportunity to give lots of presentations, build POCs, drive consensus,
                build strong client relationships with focus on customer service orientation, and finally as a Product Manager, I managed
                full product lifecycle, since definition of marketing requirements, product vision, strategy and scope definition,
                passing through development of MVPs, product roadmaps, working with Agile teams, launched the products and led all
                required post-launch activities, like performance monitoring and product sustaining. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a passion for technology and how it can transform complex problems in creative solutions.<br />
            </p>
            <p>

                I am a results-oriented and an accountable hands-on professional, who is passionate about advanced technology
                and problem-solving.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to know more, navigate througth my education, work, projects and skills. And fell free to contact me!
